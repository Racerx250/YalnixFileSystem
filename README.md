# YalnixFileSystem
COMP 421 Final Project

Stuff we need to do:
1. Fix the linked list for free blocks and nodes (maybe we don't necessarily need this)
2. CACHES lmao what is going on with this. All I know is that we can only have a certain amount of files going at once. Is that what goes in the cache?
3. We need to devise system through messaging where you can pass more information than 32 bits. For instance: the first message sent by the user sends a request to the server to wait for all of the data to be sent, which would be accomplished using the reply functionality.
